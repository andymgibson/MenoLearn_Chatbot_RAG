# MenoLearn_Chatbot_RAG
Chatbot for the MenoLearn menopause education project with the UCSD Cognitive Science Dept. using the ChatGPT API. This is the repo for the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) version of the model, sometimes called "retrieval" for short. The idea with this version is to have the chatbot pull information from our new list of sources (selected scientific papers) and cite them with a link.

This will be compared with the fine-tuning version later.
